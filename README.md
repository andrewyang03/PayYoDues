To make sure that every member in my fraternity pays their semesterly dues, we would manually text each member that is not meeting the deadline. 
However, this was very cumbersome and monotonous, so its much easier to automate the process. I used a slackbot to direct message members that have
not yet paid in the slack channel, and this can be customized on the front end to make a specific message.

To run it locally, clone the repo, ask me for the specific authentication tokens.

Once that is done, run `python3 reminder.py` inside the Scripts directory to just run the script

To view the flask application, run `python3 app.py` to open the web app.

Below is the sample page.
